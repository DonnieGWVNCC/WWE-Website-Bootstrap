                        <h2 class="subheading">Discovering Wrestling</h2>
                        <p>Ever since the age of 7 back in the year of 2006, I have watched the sport of Professional Wrestling, specifically the WWE, and yes I did say sport. Wrestling is one of the most
                            endurance driven activities in the world. The stamina and shape these wrestlers must be in to perform day after day in front of thousands of audience members at live arenas 
                            and millions of people watching from home is unbelievable. It is an art that I have come to love and respect every time I tune in, these wrestlers put their bodies and lives on the line 
                            every time they step in that ring. It's a sport, spectacle, and sometimes soap opera all tied into one. It can make you angry, it can make you happy, it can make you cheer, it
                            can make you boo, it can make your heart race, as well as it can also make your heart just about stop. It is a roller coaster ride that goes year-round, there is no off season
                            when it comes to wrestling, just as there are no playoffs. It is petal to the metal, full speed ahead all year, these performers give it their all to give us the best show 
                            every single time, and I will forever respect them for that.

                    <h2 class ="subheading">What Wrestling Means To Me</h2>
                    <p>Wrestling has always been a "home" of some sort for me, it has always been a safe place. It's something that I can always turn to, no matter what is going on in the real world,
                        whether it be my own personal life, or something going on in this ever changing world of ours, it has always been a great escape for me. It has always been something where my
                        family and I would gather around the TV to watch every Monday and every Friday, it is something that my girlfriend and I can go to live events together and make some of the 
                        best memories, it is something that I can go on and on talking about how much I absolutely love and how sometimes I absolutely hate based on the story lines. 
                        No matter what, wrestling has always been there for me. It has even been there for me during college as I usually put it on as background noise during study or homework sessions,
                        and if a PPV is happening on a Saturday it is great motivation for me to get all my work done by Saturday so I can sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Through all my years 
                        when nothing or nobody was there for me, wrestling always has been, and that is why I love it.
