                        <!--This paragraph explains how most non-wrestling fans constantly use the phrase, "It's fake", and explains why that isn't correct or fair-->
                        <h2 class="subheading">"It's so fake"</h2>
                        <p>I'm sure you have probably seen the show Stranger Things, or American Horror Story, or perhaps even The Walking Dead. Those are all very popular shows, which one of them may be your favorite
                            show. Now imagine if you were to tell somebody that one of those shows was your favorite, what would their reaction be? Their reaction may be that they love it as well, or maybe 
                            they possibly hate it, or there's a slight chance they may have never watched it before. However, I can almost gurantee you that they would never say, "Oh my goodness, you watch 
                            that stuff? It's so fake!". Nobody would say that about a zombie show, or an alien show, but for some reason it is almost always said towards a wrestling fan. That phrase is 
                            something that myself and other wrestling fans have grown tired of hearing again and again. I understand wrestling is not for everybody, just like the previous mentioned shows aren't 
                            for everybody either, but for some reason us wrestling fans are given the short end of the stick when it comes to our fandom. Of course, the winners and losers are pre-determined 
                            before the fights ever take place, but the action and physicality and risk are the farthest thing from being "fake". Are they taking legit blows to the head such as MMA and boxers do?
                            Absoulutely not, but sometimes they do. Instead, they take real chair shots to their backs and abdomens, they perform high-flying maneuvers in which there is no gurantee that they 
                            will land safely, they jump from distances as high as 15-feet in the air, they fall backwards, they go through tables, they fall off ladders, they climb steel cages, they take hard 
                            bumps on the mat, and there is nothing fake about the bruises and cuts that they sustain. The risk they take is real, and sometimes they pay the real price for it.

                    <h2 class ="subheading">The Price to Pay</h2>
                    <p>If something was "fake" then that would mean nobody could get hurt, there wouldn't be any accidents, but that is not the case for these athletes. There are several 
                        tweaks that they feel in the morning the day after, but some wrestlers have unfortunately had to pay the ultimate price, sometimes having their career ended, or even their ability to get 
                        around properly. I will never forget watching one of my favorite wrestlers of all time, Adam Copeland, also known by his ring name "Edge" have to retire his reign of the World Heavyweight
                        Championship due to his real life neck surgeries suffered at the hands of being a professional wrestler, with the diagnosis being cervical spinal stenosis. With the advancement of modern day 
                        medicine, Edge was able to make his triumphant return to the ring in 2020. Neck issues are common within the world of professional wrestling, as Daniel Bryan had to retire in 2016, as well
                        as Paige being forced to retire in 2018. Thankfully, as did Edge, both Daniel and Paige were successfully able to return to the squared circle and live out their professional dream as they
                        all three still do to this day. Of course there are your typical injuries such as torn muscles, concussions, sprains, and broken bones. However, some injuries do not have a happy ending
                        and some are much more serious than a torn or sprained ligament. A tragic story was the story of Darren Drozdov, who wrestled under the ring name, "Droz". On October 5th, 1999, Droz was set 
                        to take on a wrestler with the ring name, "D'Lo Brown" on the show "WWF SmackDown!". What started off as a typical match quickly took a turn for the worst when D'Lo attempted to pick up 
                        Droz in a power-bomb position. Due to Droz's ring gear being baggy, D'Lo had a hard time securing a grip when he had Droz off the mat and in the air. D'Lo unfortunately lost control and dropped
                        Droz straight down onto his neck. The fall caused Droz to fracture two vertebrae in his neck, thus paralyzing him for the rest of his life. Droz unfortunately passed away on June 30th, 2023 at the 
                        age of 54. That is one of the most tragic of instances, but there are many other battles that are fought outside of the ring, with many wrestlers abusing painkillers and alcohol and other substance 
                        issues. Many wrestlers such as Mick Foley and Hulk Hogan have a hard time getting around due to the wear and tear their bodies have taken. The injuries and risks that can occur in the NFL are never 
                        questioned, so neither should the ones in professional wrestling.
