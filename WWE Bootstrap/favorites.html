                        <p>One of my favorite topics and things to ponder about and discuss, is who my all-time favorite wrestlers are. Since I only began watching in 2006, I missed out on the likes of The Rock, 
                            Stone Cold Steve Austin, and the prime era of the Attitude Era. However, I have been able to witness some amazing wrestling and now I'm going to attempt my best to give you my top 5 
                            favorite wrestlers of all-time.

                        <h2 class ="subheading">Number 5</h2>
                        <p>I'm going to start off with my number five favorite wrestler of all-time, and he is no other than The Architect, Seth "Freakin" Rollins. This particular wrestler is the current World Heavyweight 
                            Champion in modern day WWE. Seth debuted on November 18th, 2012, on the PPV known as Survivor Series alongside with his tag partners Roman Reigns, and Dean Ambrose, forming a trio known as 
                            The Shield. The three made quite an impact on their arrival as they interferred in the main event match for the WWE Championship involving John Cena, CM Punk, and Ryback. The Shield had an amazing run 
                            as a trio team, until Seth turned his back on his brothers and flew "solo". Seth was always the one looked at to succeed as being a solo competitor out of the three, and did he ever. Seth went on
                            to be able to change his character several times from good to bad and wear many different personas, the whole time keeping the fans interested. He found great success and went on to win the Money in 
                            The Bank, become a 2-time WWE Champion, a 2-time Universal Champion, a 2-time Intercontinental Champion, a 2-time United States Champion, a 6-time Tag Team Champion, and winner of the Royal Rumble match.
                            Seth Rollins is already in the conversation as one of the all-time greats and he is still going, looking to create an even more impressive resume.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Number 4</h2>
                        <p>Coming in at number four, is none other than the current, reigning, Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns. Right now, Roman Reigns is on a historical run, as his title reign has lasted at the current 
                            time of writing, an astonishing 1,108 days. This has put Reigns in the record books as having the fourth longest World Championship reign in WWE history only being put behind the reigns of Bruno Sammartino (1,237 days),
                            Hulk Hogan (1,474 days), Bob Backlund (2,135 days), and Bruno Sammartino(2,803 days). Following in the similar foot steps of his Shield brother Seth Rollins, Reigns has had great solo success as his accolades 
                            are as followed: 2-time Universal Champion, 4-time WWE Champion, United States Champion, Intercontinental Champion, Tag-Team Champion, as well as winning the Royal Rumble match. Reigns is on one of the greatest 
                            runs of not only the modern day, but of all time. His run of being the face of the WWE has no end in sight, and it is amazing to witness.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Number 3</h2>
                        <p>At the number three slot, is The Viper, The Legend Killer, Randy Orton. Randy started putting on unforgettable performances for the WWE audience in April of 2002 when he debuted. Orton had a very early start to success 
                            as he joined a faction with the name Evolution alongside with all time greats such as Triple H, Ric Flair, and Batista. The group found great success as Randy Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion as he won the 
                            championship on August 15th, 2004 at the WWE PPV known as SummerSlam. This was a great precursor to the success that Orton was going to entail in his lenghty career as his accolades are as followed: 14-time WWE Champion, 
                            Intercontinental Champion, United States Champion, 3-time Tag Team Champion, 2-time Royal Rumble winner, Money in the Bank winner, Grand Slam Champion, as well as being a Triple Crown Champion. He is tied for the third
                            amount of World Championship reigns at 14, only behind Ric Flair, John Cena, and tied with Triple H. Orton has had an incredibly successful career, he is currently out with an injured back. I hope for him to return, however, he 
                            has had nothing to regret in his unforgettable career.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Number 2</h2>
                        <p>My second best wrestler of all time, is The Rated-R Superstar, Edge. Edge has had an amazing, lenghty run in the WWE, as he debuted back on June 2nd, 1998. Although Edge debuted before I was born, he has had quite an impact on me 
                            during my time of watching him perform. He is one the greatest bad guys of all-time. He knows exactly just what to say and do to get under your skin, but you almost have to love him as much as you hate him. Unfortunately, Edge has missed
                            out on a great deal of his career, as he had to retire in 2011 due to cervical spinal stenosis. Miracously, he was able to make his triumphant return to the ring in the 2020 Royal Rumble. He has always been one of my favorites, and 
                            I never got to see him in person, which I thought I never would once he retired in 2011. However, I got the chance when I went to an episode of Monday Night RAW in Pittsburgh in August of 2022. It was one of the highlights of my night 
                            and I felt so many emotions as the little kid inside of me felt alive when I got to see one of my favorite wrestlers in person for the first time ever. Edge has achieved the following: 7-time Heavyweight Champion, 4-time WWE Champion, 5-time 
                            Intercontinental Champion, United States Champion, 14-time Tag Team Champion, 2-time Royal Rumble winner, King of the Ring winner, Money in the Bank winner, and WWE Hall of Famer. Edge has had a Hall of Fame career, and that is why he 
                            is number two on my list.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Number 1</h2>
                        <p>My number one favorite professional wrestler of all time, is The Game, The King of Kings, The Cerebral Assassin, Triple H. I will never forget the first time I had ever tuned into WWE, the first rivalry I ever witnessed was the Big Show and 
                            Triple H. Triple H was the bad guy, also known as the "heel", and he played it marvelously. Of course, I was rooting for the Big Show, so I vividly remember there was an attack from Triple H where he had broken Big Show's hand. This was all 
                            part of the story line of course, however, 7 year old me was bought to tears due to this act. It's quite funny that at the time, my most hated wrestler has become my favorite wrestler of all-time. Unfortunately, I never was able to experience
                            him in person, but I couldn't take my eyes off the tv once he was on it. There was nothing in WWE I was more intrigued with than the storylines with him, as they were must see. We all have favorite characters in tv shows, and he was absolutely mine.
                            He was a great "heel", however he played a good guy just as good, also known as a "babyface". Triple H debuted even before Edge did, all the way back on March 24th, 1992. He has experienced one of the greatest wrestling careers to date, with the 
                            following achievements: 14-time WWE Champion(tied third for most amount of reigns), 5-time Intercontinental Champion, 3-time Tag Team Champion, 2-time European Champion, King of the Ring winner, 2-time Royal Rumble winner, Grand Slam Champion, 
                            Triple Crown Champion, and WWE Hall of Famer. Unfortunately, in September of 2021, Triple H suffered a "cardica event" due to a genetic heart issue. This caused him to retire from in-ring performance, however, he is not going anywhere.
                            Triple H has now gone behind the scenes where he is now Head of Creative of the WWE, and runs the day-to-day operations of the company. I may not have ever experienced him perform live, but that doesn't stop him from being number one on my 
                            all-time favorite wrestlers list.
